I'm focusing on a cost efficient and reliable pc build. The items are based on their preformance first, then cost. It will *just barely* 
be able to run 1080p graphics. I'll also make it so it will be easy to upgrade in the future.
                                                                                              $$$
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3400G 3.7 GHz Quad-Core Processor-------------------------------------------$144.89                                  
  Why: Integrated graphics make it reliable to run when you don't have a VC. It will be a little better than the rest of the machine, but
  it will also leave room for upgrades!
CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 33.84 CFM CPU Cooler-------------------------------------------$39.90
  Why: It's cheep, quiet, and has good reviews.
MoBo: MSI X570-A PRO ATX AM4 Motherboard-----------------------------------------------------$149.89
  Why: I would've used a micro ATX, but a beefier MoBo will leave room for easy upgrades in the future.
RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3000 Memory---------------------------------$64.98
  Why: Good reviews, cheep price.
Memory Drive: Intel 660p Series 1.02 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive----------------------$99.99
  Why: good reviews and SSD's are great for personal use. It's also insanely cheep for an ssd.
PSU: Corsair RM (2019) 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply---------------$109.99
  Why: Even though the innitial wattage I need is lower than the 750 I'm building, It is good in case you want upgrades or plug many things
  into your computer. 
Video Card: Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 2 GB Silent Low Profile Video Card----------------------$87.99
  Why: It has the graphics I desire. Really cheep and good reviews. Silent.
Tower: Fractal Design Focus G ATX Mid Tower Case---------------------------------------------$55.88
  Why: Looks good and has good reviews.
 Opperating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit-------------------------------------$99.89
  Why: It is the easiest system to use in my opinion, and up to date.-----------------TOTAL =$838.40
                                                                            
Compatibility issues = none
